# A Great Suggestion #
<i>A Simple "Amazon-style" Recommender System</i>

<h4>Let's start out simple</h4>
This is extremely simple recommendation engine:
- List a user
- Add a 'purchased' item to the user
- Assign the item a number
- Assign that item to a category
- Check the purchased item against the closest item in its category
- Suggest another item from a similar category for the user to purchase

<h4>Machine Learning</h4>
- Fit items into categories
- Associate items and categories with Sparse Distributed Representation
- Match 'nearest neighbor' to make recommendation

<h4>Technical Details</h4>
- Jaccard Index Formula (Binary Sparse Distributed)
- Single Dimension Euclidean Similarity
- Python!
